# Project Management API

## Project Description
This API was made using C#, ASP.NET Core Web API and SQLite. The application lets a user perform CRUD-based operations on entities such as: `Bugs`, `Projects`, `Project Managers` and `Employees`. ADO.NET was used to establish a connection to the SQLite database, and each entity has it's own repository data-access class and interface that defines the different data-access implementations available for each repository class.
